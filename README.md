# Automotive-Black-Box
CDAC Hyderabad Final Project

ABSTRACT
The project focuses on implementing a reliable Black Box system for
accident analysis. Similar to black box systems in airplanes, the technology
is used to analyze the cause of vehicular accidents and prevent the loss of
life and and property arising from such accidents. Successful analysis is done
by tracking sensor data and making the data available in IoT cloud servers
such as Thinkspeak for the general public or specific users to access. An
ESP32 board which uses the Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor is at the
core of the system and is interfaced with temperature, ultrasonic, vibration
and alcohol sensors to achieve the desired analysis. The inbuilt WiFi
connectivity of the ESP32 is made to use to push data via HTTP protocol to a
reliable IoT cloud from where it is accessed.
